# Sparktech FE Candidate pre-interview app

Hi, there! Thanks for your interest in the FE Developer position at Sparktech Software. The following app contains several challenges we got for you.

Your quest is to change this app until it meets the requirements mentioned in the other README.md files.

We recommend starting with the README.md file from `src/features/Dashboard`. See you there!

## Oh right...

You might want to know how to start this app. Well, it's not big deal, just run `yarn` to install all the dependencies and `yarn start` to start the app.

I guess you can use npm too.

## And finally

Send us the final codebase as an archive, but don't forget to **remove node_modules** before zipping it.

Good luck!
